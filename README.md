# MUtils
A **M**odule (VBA scripts) contains some **U**tils procedures for worksheets using the [star module](http://www.openoffice.org/api/docs/common/ref/com/sun/star/module-ix.html).

## Purpose
The purpose of this module is to **facilitate the creation of macros for spreadsheets**.

Because, although the standard VBA spreadsheet modules are very good, there is a lot of effort to use them to do simple tasks. So I decided to create MUtils, to make tasks simple, as simple as calling only 1 procedure.

## Getting Started
First [download](https://github.com/RafaelYon/MUtils/releases) the latest version of MUtils. Now Import this module into your spreadsheet macro project.
